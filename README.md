# Food World Delivery

This project is a simple Order Delivery System example of popular e-commerce websites such as Amazon and Flipkart. An order management system (OMS) is a digital method of managing an order's lifetime. It keeps track of all information and processes, such as order entry, inventory management, fulfilment, and after-sales support. An OMS provides visibility to both the company and the buyer. The data in our project is easily retrievable. The interface is straightforward to use. The data is well safeguarded for personal use, and the processing is rapid.

## Front end tools:
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja : We used all these tools for creating the user interface.
- Back end tools:
  - MySQL : The database at the backend uses MySql. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
  - Flask :It is a micro web framework for Python. Flask is used for the backend, but it uses a templating language called Jinja2, which is used to create HTML, XML or other markup formats that are returned to the user via an HTTP request.
